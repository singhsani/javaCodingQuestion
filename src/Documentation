Q. Write a function to find out duplicate words in a
given string?

Approach
1. Define a string.
2. Convert the string into lowercase to make the comparison insensitive.
3. Split the string into words.
4. Two loops will be used to find duplicate words. Outer loop will select a word and
Initialize variable count to 1. Inner loop will compare the word selected by outer
loop with rest of the words.
5. If a match found, then increment the count by 1 and set the duplicates of word to
'0' to avoid counting it again.
6. After the inner loop, if count of a word is greater than 1 which signifies that the
word has duplicates in the string.

Approach 2
1. Define a string.
2. Convert the string into lowercase to make the comparison insensitive.
3. Split the string into words.
4. using map
5. make word as a key value in incremental manner
6. check key are available increase value +1
7. check value are grater than 1 print


Q. Find the missing number in an array?
Approach
1. Calculate A = n (n+1)/2 where n is largest number in series 1…N.
2. Calculate B = Sum of all numbers in given series
3. Missing number = A – B

Q. Write a java program to swap two string variables
without using temp variable?
Approach
1. Append second string to first string and store in first string:
a=a+b
2. call the method substring(int beginning, int endindex)
by passing beginindex as 0 and endindex as,
a.length() - b.length():
b = substring(0,a.length()-b.length());
3. call the method substring(int beginindex) by passing
b.length() as argument to store the value of initial
b string in a
a = substring(b.length());


Q. How to print all permutations of a String in Java?
Approach
1. Define a string.
2. Fix a character and swap the rest of the characters.
3. Call the generatePermutation() for rest of the characters.
4. Backtrack and swap the characters again.
